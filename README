tk-score - a tool for setting up, scoring and reporting on a soccer
league.  

This is a huge work in progress, and has lots of built-in assumptions
that are slowing being addressed:

- all data structures are globals, moving slowing to a more Object
  Oriented setup.

- It's hard coded for an eight or nine team season using round robin
  so that every team plays each other twice, and at both the earlier and
  later times.

- all games are scheduled once a week at two times across two fields.

- For outdoor seasons, we have teams lining the fields, which impacts
  the schedules.

- In the process of updating code to support only six teams, with
  three different time/field combos on a night.  



Wishlist:

- automatic schedule generator, instead of hard-codeds ones used now.

- complete move to object oriented perl for data structures.

- better documentation of the data structure used to store data.

- support for versioned data files.  Not too important.

- automated testing of modules.
